**mlBionets** is an R package designed to comprehensively
analyze microbiota data using a multilayer network approach. This
package enables researchers to integrate and analyze multiple types of
biological data, providing a robust framework for studying complex
microbial communities and their interactions within different
environmental and biological contexts.

**Features**

- **Multilayer Network Construction:** Build and visualize multilayer
  networks from microbiota data, incorporating various layers such as
  phylogenetic, functional, and environmental information.

- **Data Integration:** Seamlessly integrate different types of
  microbiota data, including taxonomic profiles and metadata

- **Advanced Analysis Tools:** Perform network-based analyses, including
  community detection, network centrality, and inter-layer connectivity.

- **Visualization:** Generate publication-quality visualizations to
  illustrate complex network structures and interactions.

- **Customizable Workflows:** Easily customize analysis workflows to
  suit specific research needs, facilitating reproducible and flexible
  data analysis.
