\usage{
v_colored_ml (g.list, T_table, g_tax, p_tax, g_colors)
}
\arguments{
\item{g.list}{List of igraph objects (multilayer network).}

\item{T_table}{Taxa table (as data.frame).}

\item{g_tax}{The taxonomic level at which the nodes will be colored.}

\item{p_tax}{The taxonomic level at which the network was built.}

\item{g_colors}{Set of colors. The vector must have the same length of g_tax elements.}
}
\value{
An igraph object.
}
\description{
Assigns a color to each node of a multilayer network depending of their taxonomic level, for example, the phylum.
