  mlBionets is an R package designed to comprehensively
  analyze microbiota data using a multilayer network
  approach. This package enables researchers to integrate
  and analyze multiple types of biological data, providing a
  robust framework for studying complex microbial
  communities and their interactions within different
  environmental and biological contexts.


  Features


  Multilayer Network Construction: Build and visualize
  multilayer networks from microbiota data, incorporating
  various layers such as phylogenetic, functional, and
  environmental information.

  Data Integration: Seamlessly integrate different types of
  microbiota data, including taxonomic profiles and metadata

  Advanced Analysis Tools: Perform network-based analyses,
  including community detection, network centrality, and
  inter-layer connectivity.

  Visualization: Generate publication-quality visualizations
  to illustrate complex network structures and interactions.

  Customizable Workflows: Easily customize analysis
  workflows to suit specific research needs, facilitating
  reproducible and flexible data analysis.
